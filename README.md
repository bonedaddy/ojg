# OjG

Optimized JSON for Go is a high performance parser with a variety of
additional JSON tools.

## Features

 - Fast JSON parser. Check out the cmd/benchmarks app in this repo.
 - Full JSONPath implemenation that operates on simple types as well as structs.
 - Generic types. Not the proposed golang generics but type safe JSON elements.
 - Fast JSON validator.
 - Fast JSON writer with a sort option.
 - Simple data builders using a push and pop approach.
 - Object encoding and decoding using an approach similar to that used with Oj for Ruby.

## Using

A basic Parse:

```golang
    obj, err := oj.ParseString(`{
        "a":[
            {"x":1,"y":2,"z":3},
            {"x":2,"y":4,"z":6}
        ]
    }`)
```

Using JSONPath expressions:

```golang
    x, err := jp.ParseString("a[?(@.x > 1)].y")
    ys := x.Get(obj)
    // returns [4]
```

The **oj** command (cmd/oj) which uses JSON path for filtering and
extracting JSON elements. It also includes sorting, reformatting, and
colorizing options.

```
$ oj -m "(@.name == 'Pete')" myfile.json

```

## Installation
```
go get github.com/ohler55/ojg
go get github.com/ohler55/ojg/cmd/oj

```

or just import in your `.go` files.

```
import (
    "github.com/ohler55/ojg/alt"
    "github.com/ohler55/ojg/gen"
    "github.com/ohler55/ojg/jp"
    "github.com/ohler55/ojg/oj"
